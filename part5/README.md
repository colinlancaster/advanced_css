# More Natours!

## Basic Responsive Design Principles

1. Fluid Grids and Layouts - To allow content to easily adapt to the current viewport width used to browse the website. Uses `%` rather than `px` for all layout-related lengths.

2. Flexible and Responsive Images - Images behave differently than text content, and so we need to ensure that they also adapt nicely to the current viewport.

3. Media Queries - To change styles on certain viewport widths (breakpoints), allowing us to create a different version of our website for different widths.

## Layout Types

1. Float-Based Layouts (no!)
2. Flexbox
3. CSS Grid

> In this course we will focus on Float Layouts for the Natours project. Each project will touch on the different layout types.
